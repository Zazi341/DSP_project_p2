# DSP_project_p2
 Part 2 of a 2-part Digital Signal Processing project, focusing on advanced filtering techniques and frequency domain operations. This section, completed in collaboration with two fellow students, fulfills the objectives outlined in the accompanying document


# Summary:
The project involves designing and implementing digital filters to process noisy signals. Key tasks include:

Constructing analog and digital low-pass filters (LPFs) with specific design parameters (e.g., cutoff frequencies, ripple constraints).
Translating analog filter specifications into the digital domain using frequency warping techniques.
Validating the filter design and assessing performance by comparing filtered signals with original noisy signals.
Experimenting with various windowing functions (e.g., Hamming, Hann, Kaiser) to achieve effective frequency separation and noise suppression.
Applying advanced frequency domain techniques to enhance signal clarity and minimize interference.
This section builds on foundational concepts from Part 1, applying them to real-world filtering challenges in the frequency domain.
